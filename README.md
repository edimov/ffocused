# ffocused
A service to showcase your pictures online.

We believe that a portfolio should display only your most stunning work, 
with no clutter & in a layout designed for your photos.

See http://ffocused.com for more about what this is all about.

## Configuration
It is not yet possible to simply set up localy or on your own server a copy of ffocused.
If you want to help out, please contact us directly and we'll figure out a solution

## Tests
Tests are made with rspec2. There isn't enough tests yet, we are working on it.

Any pull request needs to have its set of tests to be accepted (except
for themes).

## Compatibility
ffocused runs on Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.8.7, but the support for 1.8.7 will be
soon dropped.

ffocused aims to be compatible with recent browsers, meaning Firefox,
Safari, Chrome and IE8+. Creators of new themes should take this into consideration.
