        To get started, you first need to link your account with your Flickr user. You can only link to one user. <br />
        While you're at it, you might as well set a title & description for your portfolio!

        Categories allow you to sort your photos. Each category is linked to one or more Flickr tags.
        Keep in mind that you can only display a maximum of <strong>15</strong> photos.

        This will fetch all the pictures again from Flickr, discarding the titles, 
        descriptions and order you might have already set.
        This action is not reversible.
