        Alright, your <strong>%{service}</strong> account <strong>%{name}</strong> has been 
        linked properly to a Rlvnt. 
        You can add another one at any time in the 'Photo Account' section.<br /><br />
        Have fun playing around in the backoffice!

        Cool, you have linked multiple photo accounts to your portfolio. 
        Let us know if you think we should support other services!
      not_setup: |
        Welcome to Rlvnt! <br /><br />
        To get started, you first need to link your Rlvnt account with your account on one of the supported photo services.
        So far we support Flickr and Facebook.

        Categories allow you to sort your photos. <br /><br /> 
        Only public photos will be fetched.
        Each category must be linked to one of your photo accounts.
        Keep in mind that you can only display a maximum of <strong>15</strong> photos, so pick your best work!

      reset: |
        Reset all photos in this category. 
        This will fetch all the pictures again from the linked photo account, discarding the titles, 
        descriptions and order you might have already set.
        Be careful, this action is not reversible.
